# Pre-Commit Checklist

## ✅ ALWAYS Test Locally Before Committing

### For Dashboard/React Changes:
1. **Navigate to dashboard directory**
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if needed)
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run build to check for errors**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - ✅ Must complete successfully with "Compiled successfully"
   - ❌ If build fails, fix errors before committing

4. **Test locally** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - Verify app loads and works correctly

### For Server/Python Changes:
1. **Check syntax**
   ```bash
   python -m py_compile server/app.py
   ```

2. **Run basic import test**
   ```bash
   python -c "import server.app"
   ```

3. **Test endpoints** (if possible)
   ```bash
   python server/app.py
   # Test /health endpoint
   ```

### For Swift App Changes:
1. **Build the app**
   ```bash
   cd desktop-swift
   ./build.sh
   ```

2. **Verify it compiles without errors**

### General Rules:
- ✅ **NEVER commit code that doesn't build locally**
- ✅ **ALWAYS run `npm run build` for React/dashboard changes**
- ✅ **ALWAYS verify Python syntax for server changes**
- ✅ **Check for linter errors before committing**
- ✅ **Test the specific functionality you changed**

### If Build Fails Locally:
- ❌ **DO NOT COMMIT**
- ✅ Fix the errors first
- ✅ Re-test until build passes
- ✅ Then commit

**Remember: If it doesn't work locally, it won't work on Render!**
